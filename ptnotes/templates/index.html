<p>Pentest Notes allows testers to keep track of what can be done, has been done, and still needs to be done during a network penetration test. To use Pentest Notes, import Nessus or Nmap XML files into the server using the <a href="/import">Scan Data</a> tab. The imported data will be organized by hosts and attacks. You can view a list of hosts by using the <a href="/hosts">Hosts</a> tab and view a list of attacks using the <a href="/attacks">Attacks</a> tab. If you would like to make suggestions to improve the tool, submit code, or report issues please head over to <a href="https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/ptnotes">Github</a> and contribute.</p>
